Introduction
This project aims to predict the presence of thyroid diseases using various health-related features such as age, gender, TSH levels, and other thyroid-related data. It leverages machine learning models and offers a user-friendly interface for inputting data and receiving predictions.

Technologies
The following technologies were used to build this project:

Python – Programming language for backend and machine learning model.
Django – Web framework for the application.
Scikit-learn – For machine learning model implementation.
Pandas – For data manipulation and processing.
Matplotlib/Seaborn – For visualizations (if needed).
HTML/CSS – For frontend design.
SQLite – For local database management.
Setup
To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
Python (>=3.x)
pip – Python package installer.
Installation:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/hemhemaK/ThyroidDisease-Check.git
cd ThyroidDisease-Check
Create a virtual environment: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
bash
Copy
Edit
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:
bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Migrate the database:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
Run the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py runserver
The server should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Usage
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You will find the following features:

Input Data Form: Fill in the required fields with health data (e.g., age, gender, TSH levels).
Prediction Button: After filling out the form, click "Check Thyroid Disease" to get the prediction.
Results Page: The prediction (positive/negative) will be displayed, along with the probability.
